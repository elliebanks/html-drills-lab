            <h2>My Pets</h2>
            <p>i have a collie named blu. he is cute and sweet, but he sheds too much. i also
                live with 3 cats named fritz, zazie, and junior. i didn't get much sleep last night
                because zazie likes to cry for food at 4 in the morning. every day. i call her a
                bad daughter when she does this, but i forgive her. i really like animals, especially:

            <h3>I hate reading HELLO WORLD! over and over</h3>
            <p>i am learning to code html. i just quit my serving job. i am really happy
                to never work in a restaurant again. i
                worked at the same bbq restaurant for almost 5 years. there are many things that i won't
                miss about that job.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>always smelling like onion rings</li>
                <li>customers asking "so what's good here?"</li>
                <li>customers seating themselves at tables and then complaining when they don't have a server</li>
                <li>not being able to tell if people are ordering an unsweet tea, or 'uhhh' sweet tea</li>
                <li>having to brew gallons of sweet tea multiple times a day</li>
                <li>when customers ask me what an IPA beer tastes like</li>
                <li>asking a customer how they are doing and them responding with their drink order</li>
                <li>strangers telling me to smile more</li>
                <li>serving cold beer while sweating in the hot sun</li>
                <li>when i am busy and someone shakes an empty cup at me</li>
                <li>when a table tells me they are ready to order and then no one knows what they want</li>

            <p>i have no idea what my favorite movie is, but i chose this one because it was my favorite
                when i was in high school. it is about a guy that goes back to his hometown after being away for years
                because his mother passed away. when he returns home he stops taking the mood meds that he had been on
                since
                he was a child because he wants to feel and experience life again. he meets a love interest and they
                go on a little journey.
